# dying with serial

  Just a few tests with a led, an arduino and serial
  
<b>ino:</b> Contains the file with the emission and reading of the arduino serial

<b>api:</b> Contains a server / api made in python using flask, it has endpoints to accept connections and send values to arduino serial. Not the best practice, but worth the test.

<b>web:</b> Contains a react application that consumes api and is able to light up the led via the button.

<b>mobile:</b> Contains a react native application that also consumes api, being able to turn on and off the led.

<b>pong:</b> Contains an extremely simple version of pong game, implemented in javascript using the p5.js library. When the ball hits any of the paddles the led will turn off or on.
